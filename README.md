## About
This repository contains 10 lab projects completed as part of the **CS1412: Programming Principles** course at Texas Tech University. Each lab focuses on a different foundational concept in C programming, covering topics such as arithmetic operations, string manipulation, file handling, dynamic memory allocation, and data structures like arrays, structs, and linked lists.

## Labs Overview

1. **Lab 1: Tip Calculator**
   - **Topic:** Basic Input/Output and Arithmetic Operations
   - **Description:** Implements a program to calculate the tip per person and total bill per person based on user input.

2. **Lab 2: Orbital Speed Calculation**
   - **Topic:** Mathematical Computations and Functions
   - **Description:** Calculates the orbital speed of a satellite using functions for mathematical operations.

3. **Lab 3: Prime Numbers and String Manipulation**
   - **Topic:** Loops, Prime Number Calculation, and String Operations
   - **Description:** Focuses on prime number calculation and string manipulation through functions.

4. **Lab 4: Matrix Transposition**
   - **Topic:** Arrays and Matrix Operations
   - **Description:** Transposes a given matrix using nested loops and two-dimensional arrays.

5. **Lab 5: Encryption and Decryption**
   - **Topic:** String Manipulation and Character Operations
   - **Description:** Encrypts and decrypts strings by manipulating the ASCII values of characters.

6. **Lab 6: Employee Management System**
   - **Topic:** Structs and File Handling
   - **Description:** A system to manage employee records with functions to add, delete, and modify records stored in a file.

7. **Lab 7: Complex Number Arithmetic**
   - **Topic:** Structs and Operator Overloading
   - **Description:** Performs arithmetic operations on complex numbers using C structs.

8. **Lab 8: Student Record Management**
   - **Topic:** Structs, File Handling, and Dynamic Memory Allocation
   - **Description:** Manages student records by utilizing dynamic memory allocation, structs, and file handling.

9. **Lab 9: Polynomial Arithmetic**
   - **Topic:** Linked Lists and Dynamic Data Structures
   - **Description:** Uses linked lists to perform arithmetic operations on polynomials.

10. **Lab 10: Inventory Management System**
    - **Topic:** Structs, File Handling, and Conditional Logic
    - **Description:** Manages inventory data using file handling and structs to check if items need restocking.
